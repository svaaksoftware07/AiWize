Financial organizations must deploy robust marketing strategies to create awareness, generate leads, and acquire customers. This involves advertising campaigns, digital marketing initiatives, participation in industry events, and collaborations with influencers, all of which come with a hefty price tag. Distribution channels also contribute to GTM costs, particularly for organizations aiming to reach a broader audience. Establishing partnerships with banks, payment gateways, and other financial institutions incurs expenses in the form of integration fees, revenue sharing agreements, and operational costs associated with maintaining these relationships."
